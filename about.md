Yo! I’m Han Wang, an ECE & CS undergrad @ UW-Madison who’s figuring out his place in the world. I care a lot about my family/friends and always look for ways to spend more time with them, either jamming or going on foolish adventures together. I think a lot about tech and how it can make meaningful impacts on society. 

I like programming and building things. Many of my personal projects can be found in [Github](https://github.com/WangHanSolo). I’ve been part of  building chess engines, messenger bots, and autonomous systems. I learned a lot through these experiences and look forward to talking about them!

I spend a lot of my time helping faculty @ UW-Madison on to utilize technology to different fields of application. I worked on implementing Computer Vision techniques in surgical equipment and construction automation. I believe Computer Vision is one of the most transformatively impactful tech in the future.

Right now, I am part of Simulation Based Engineering Lab([SBEL](https://sbel.wisc.edu/)) at UW-Madison.  At SBEL, I assist Asher Elmquist in contributing to the sensor simulation for autonomous vehicles in Project Chrono, and open source physics based simulation infrastructure. Techniques I focus on are computer graphics and parallel computing. I have learned so much from working with him and the other amazing people in SBEL. Super grateful for all the time and energy they invested in me.

I love reading, especially biographies and history. I think people are fascinating and love learning how they see and interact with the world. 

I started this blog because I want to share the cool things I am learning about technology and new realizations from reading books. Let me know if you have any questions!

*Thank You for reading!*
